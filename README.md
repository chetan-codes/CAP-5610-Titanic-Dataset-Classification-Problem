# CAP5610 Titanic Dataset Classification Problem

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the CAP5610 Titanic Dataset classification problem. The goal is to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It consists of passenger information such as name, age, gender, ticket class, ticket fare, cabin, port of embarkation, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set.

## Files
- `train.csv`: CSV file containing the training dataset.
- `test.csv`: CSV file containing the test dataset.
- `hw_1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Building**: Training various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Prediction**: Making predictions on the test set and submitting to Kaggle for evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the `titanic_classification.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
